# NO_IDEA - Define to build without the IDEA algorithm
# NO_RC4  - Define to build without the RC4 algorithm
# NO_RC2  - Define to build without the RC2 algorithm
# THREADS - Define when building with threads, you will probably also need any
#           system defines as well, i.e. _REENTERANT for Solaris 2.[34]
# TERMIO  - Define the termio terminal subsystem, needed if sgtty is missing.
# TERMIOS - Define the termios terminal subsystem, Silicon Graphics.
